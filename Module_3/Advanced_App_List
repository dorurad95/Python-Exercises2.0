#Now it's time to determine the monthly average noon temperature. Add up all 31 readings recorded at noon and divide the sum by 31. You can assume that the midnight temperature is stored first. Here's the relevant code:

temps = [[0.0 for h in range(24)] for d in range(31)]
#
# The matrix is magically updated here.
#

total = 0.0

for day in temps:
    total += day[11]

average = total / 31

print("Average temperature at noon:", average)

#Note: the day variable used by the for loop is not a scalar - each pass through the temps matrix assigns it with the subsequent rows of the matrix; 
#hence, it's a list. It has to be indexed with 11 to access the temperature value measured at noon.
####################################################################################################################################################################################################################
        Now find the highest temperature during the whole month - see the code:
temps = [[0.0 for h in range(24)] for d in range(31)]
#
# The matrix is magically updated here.
#

highest = -100.0

for day in temps:
    for temp in day:
        if temp > highest:
            highest = temp

print("The highest temperature was:", highest)
####################################################################################################################################################################################################################
          Now count the days when the temperature at noon was at least 20 â„ƒ:
temps = [[0.0 for h in range(24)] for d in range(31)]
#
# The matrix is magically updated here.
#

hot_days = 0

for day in temps:
    if day[11] > 20.0:
        hot_days += 1

print(hot_days, "days were hot.")
